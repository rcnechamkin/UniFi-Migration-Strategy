# How I Built This

I’ve never done an actual wireless migration, but I studied enough botched ones to know what *not* to do. This repo pulls from:

- Official UniFi documentation and community forums
- Reddit threads in r/sysadmin, r/networking, and similar subreddits
- 15% concentrated power of will

I wrote it like I was planning for real, so I’d be ready when it is for real.

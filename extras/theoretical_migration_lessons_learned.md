# Migration Retrospective – Stuff We’d Do Better
(These are hypothetical lessons based on UniFi community forum stories, Reddit horror posts, and support documentation, not from direct field experience. Obviously.)

- Don’t trust DHCP on legacy switches. Double check VLAN tag integrity.
- Bring your own ladder.
- Have a spare AP pre-configured just in case one dies on install.
- Document SSID typos BEFORE you push them to 30 clinics.

Lessons learned are scars turned into SOPs.

# Wireless Infrastructure Migration Lab

This project was done to simulate a real-world wireless infrastructure migration from **Aruba** to **Ubiquiti UniFi** access points across 30+ remote locations. It's designed to demonstrate:

- Migration stategy
- Network design and planning
- VLAN segmentation
- Actual field execution and potential troubleshooting guidelines

---

## Project Structure
```
- "migration_plan.md" - High-level timeline and migration approach
- "vlan_mapping_strategy.md" - Logical VLAN design and subnetting strategy
- "site_migration_walkthrough.md" - Step-by-step field deployment guide
- "pre_migration_backup_plan.md" - Backup and rollback strategies
- "adoption_troubleshooting.md" - UniFi adoption issues and fixes
- "how_i_built_this.md" - An explination on how this was made (spoilers: it's all just .md files and speculation based on others' experiences)
- "notes_field_considerations.md" - Physical install and site-specific quirks, found from ghost stories on reddit or communnity forums
- "assumptions_made.md" - some speculations I made while crafting this
- "templates/" - Config and communication templates
- "extras/" - Project junk drawer
```

## Lab Goals

- Mimic a real-life wireless vendor transition
- Showcase thorough planning and execution workflows
- Demonstrate readiness for a totally hypothetical mid-level network engineering project

## About This Lab

This project was created to model what a real transition from Aruba to UniFi might look like. It's basically the equivalent of drawing a network topology on a white board before actually deploying it.

While I havnâ€™t done anything like this in the field, every markdown file reflects lessons I gathered from real vendor docs, support threads, and sysadmin war stories.

I built this to just to show to myself I could do it, and as practice for when I would need to do it.

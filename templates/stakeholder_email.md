# Sample Stakeholder Email

In case the site manager is unaware or apathetic of the migration. Maybe it won't actually improve speed and reliability, but ideally it won't make anything worse. It might be a good idea to include that this is ultimately about financial effeciency.

Subject: Wireless Upgrade Scheduled – Your Location

Hi [Clinic Manager],

Just a heads up that we’re upgrading your site’s wireless equipment this week. The new system improves speed, reliability, and allows us to better support staff and guest access.

Expected downtime: ~10 minutes per AP
Guest Wi-Fi name and password will remain unchanged.

We’ll follow up with confirmation when your location is done. Let us know if anything funny happens.

Thanks,
Cody
